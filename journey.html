            After leaving a job in Chicago to come home to his Indiana roots, Peter knew he had to make some changes in his life.
            He didn't know where to start. A year later, he told himself, "Just try.". Knowing that if he did not at least try, he could not make progress.

            Pete then got a gym membership and bought an app for workingout. In the evenings he began working out five days a week.

            Months had passed and Pete had seen little progress. This is when he realized that he couldn't continue to eat the same way he did.
            After doing some research, Pete not only wanted to lose weight, but also feel good. Pete ultimately decided on the Paleo lifestyle.
            (If you are considering the Paleo lifestyle, please consult your physician before starting to see if it will work for you)

            In a nutshell, Paleo is removing processed foods, grains, beans, and most dairy from your diet. How did Pete elimiate these? Check out his <a href="recipies.html">recipies</a> page!
            He will be the first to tell you, the first week difficult, but after feel the difference you'll love it!

            Once Pete changed his eating, the pounds started flying off.
